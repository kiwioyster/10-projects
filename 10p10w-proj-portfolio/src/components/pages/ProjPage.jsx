      <h2>10 Sites in 10 Weeks</h2>
      <p>
        10 Sites in 10 weeks was a project/challenge that I took on in early
        2020. It was influenced by the{' '}

          100 Projects in 100 Days
        </a>
        . Building 100 projects in 100 days was very impressive so I wanted to
        try but I knew I didn't have the determination to do it for 100 days, so
        I settled with 10 weeks. I also wanted the projects to be a bit bigger
        and complex so I gave myself 1 week to do them.
        <br />
        <br />
        It was definitely a worthwhile experience. I faced many challenges, too
        many to list in fact. The biggest was on my 6th week when the whole
        country went into lockdown due to COVID-19 so I had to work from home,
        often overtime and on weekends. I was left with little to no time for
        this project.
        <br />

        Below you can find all 9 projects that I completed. The 10th project is
        this site that you are on right now ðŸ˜œ.
