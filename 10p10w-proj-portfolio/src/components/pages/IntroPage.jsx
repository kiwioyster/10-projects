        Greetings everyone, I'm Tony. Here you can find an archive of all my projects. Ranging from web to mobile apps. If you would like to learn more or contact me click on the 'About Me' tab on the left.
        <br />
        <br />
        The purpose of this is to keep a 'diary' of all the things I've done. At some point I might want to reuse some of the ideas or code in these projects. Currently I do not share any of the source codes. But feel free to inspect the web apps and take inspirations.
      </p>
    </div>
