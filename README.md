# 10 Projects in 10 weeks

A project/challenge that I took on in early 2020. It was influenced by the 100 Projects in 100 Days. Building 100 projects in 100 days was very impressive so I wanted to try but I knew I didn't have the determination to do it for 100 days, so I settled with 10 weeks. I also wanted the projects to be a bit bigger and complex so I gave myself 1 week to do them.

A collection of these projects can be found on [https://nohats-studio.web.app/](https://nohats-studio.web.app/)
